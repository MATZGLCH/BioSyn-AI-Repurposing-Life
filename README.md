**AI + Synthetic Biology Platform for Drug Repurposing**  
_Unlocking new treatments for cancer and rare diseases using omics intelligence._

---

## 🌱 Overview  
**Biosynthesiss** is an early-stage biotech concept that integrates **AI-driven drug repurposing**, **multi-omics analysis**, and **synthetic biology modeling** to discover new therapeutic uses for existing FDA-approved drugs.

Our mission is to dramatically reduce the time, cost, and risk of discovering effective treatments for cancer and rare diseases.

This repository contains the conceptual framework, early research pipeline, and development roadmap for the platform.

---

## 🚀 Mission  
To accelerate global drug discovery by transforming underused drugs into life-saving treatments using AI, omics data, and synthetic biology.

---

## ❗ The Problem  
Developing a new drug takes:  
- **10–15 years**  
- **$2.6B+ in cost**  
- **90%+ failure rate**

Meanwhile:  
- Thousands of FDA-approved drugs remain **underutilized**  
- Many cancers and rare diseases have **no effective treatment**  
- Wet-lab validation is expensive and slow  

Drug repurposing is powerful — but requires sophisticated computational and biological insights.

## 🔬 Our Approach  

### **1. AI-Driven Drug Repurposing**  
Machine learning models analyze:  
- Omics datasets  
- Literature databases  
- Chemical structure relationships  
- Disease signatures  

To predict new drug–disease matches.

---

### **2. Biological Pathway Simulation**  
We model how drugs affect:  
- Gene expression pathways  
- Protein interaction networks  
- Disease-specific signaling patterns  

This provides deeper biological validation before actual wet-lab testing.

---

### **3. Synthetic Biology Optimization**  
Using computational SynBio design, we explore:  
- Modified drug variants  
- Prodrug strategies  
- Alternative delivery systems  
- Optimized biosynthesis routes  

This increases therapeutic potential.
